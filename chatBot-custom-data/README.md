## Building a chatBot using Gemini API trained on custom data
Developed a chatbot using Gemini AI with RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) LLM (Large Language Model) to query specific non-sensitive user data and frequently asked questions, thereby enhancing users' self-service abilities and reducing the volume 
of claims processed by the Customer Service team
The front-end of the application is built using Reactjs.
The back-end of the application is built using Python Flask.
